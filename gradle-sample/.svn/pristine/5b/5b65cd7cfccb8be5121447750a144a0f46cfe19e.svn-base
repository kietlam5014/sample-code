HP has recorded and transmitted the serial number and date you first turned on this device to determine the start of warranty.  The product warranty process is automatic, and should you need HP’s support, this automatic process shortens the time to determine your warranty entitlement.<br/><h5>Why register?</h5> At HP, we are dedicated to delivering the best customer experience to you. If you happen to need support, the registration information we have about you and this device will allow our support team to help you quickly.  <br/><br/> Also, if you agree to let us contact you, we will send you product and service offers, support updates, market research opportunities, or other event news.
